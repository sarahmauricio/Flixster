### Notes

- I was having a little trouble getting my API key and finding everything on that website since I had never done it before. After messing around with it a little bit, I was able to figure it out.
- I ran into a small error where I accidently tried tried to access into a variables view by ID instead of setting the variable equal to it. As a result my app crashed when I clicked a container, but I soon figured out what was happening.

### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- It would not go into onSuccess in the inital part of the project. To fix this, I redid the project, and it ended up working fine.
